# Best_Gray_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Data Structures project

Project Summary
We made a hash table with multiple hash functions. The user chooses which hash function to use. The user has options of functions using multiplication, random numbers, summation, scrabble, and SHA1. The goal is to test which hash function leads to the fewest collisions.

How To Run
Download/ Pull the Makefile, Final.cpp, HashTable.cpp, and HashTable.h and run the make file ('make Final' in the Linux terminal emulator).  Please note that the makefile is not automatically included in git pull.  The program should prompt the user for input and the user should provide the requested information via the via the infreface with the terminal (that is, the user puts input into the terminal).

Dependencies
None

System Requirements
May only work on Linux.  Has not been tested on Mac or Windows.

Group Members

Open Issues/Bugs
Collision count remains unchanged when items are deleted
The find code should check for valid input and the delete code may not be working correctly.
