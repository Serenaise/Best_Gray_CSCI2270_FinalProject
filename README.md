# Best_Gray_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Data Structures project


We plan to make a hash table with multiple hash functions.  The user will choose which hash function to use.  The user will have options like functions using multiplication, random numbers, and division.  The goal is to test which hash function leads to the fewest collisions.
